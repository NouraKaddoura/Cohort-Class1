## DevSecOps Cohort Session 1 - Start with Git (Version Control)

Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

It is a core component of DevOps, continuous delivery pipelines and cloud-native computing.

## Using Tools like Github
At the heart of GitHub is an open source version control system (VCS) called Git.

To use Git on the command line, you'll need to download, install, and configure Git on your computer.

## Option 1: Download github desktop (if you don't want to use the command line)

If you want to work with Git locally, but don't want to use the command line, you can instead download and install the GitHub Desktop client. For more information, see "Getting started with GitHub Desktop.

check to see if git is installed: `git --version`
if you already have it installed you can update it:  `git clone https://github.com/git/git`
